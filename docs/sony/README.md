# CameraSync docs

This folder contains general architectural information about the app, and protocol/flow
documentation for vendor-specific quirks and features.

Note that the documentation in this folder is 100% generated by an LLM/agent and there is no human
involvement in the reversing of the vendor apps' logic to compile this documentation.
